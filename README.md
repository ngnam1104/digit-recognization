# Digit Recognization

## Overview
This project implements a digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with NumPy from scratch. The model is trained to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- **Handwritten Digit Recognition**: Classifies digits (0-9) with high accuracy.
- **Custom CNN Implementation**: Built using NumPy without deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Dataset**: Uses the MNIST dataset for training and evaluation.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy metrics and visualizations of predictions.
